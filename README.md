# Sequential-taillight-turnlsignal-brakelight
Sequential taillight turnsignal brakelight and DRL. The circuit has to be small so I opted for the ATtiny84. The indicator lights are sequential from all on to all off. When the brake is hit, all led's turn on. When the brake is hit and one of the indictor switches is triggered, one side stay's on and the other is a sequential running turn light.
